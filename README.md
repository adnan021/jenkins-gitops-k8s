Jenkins GitOps Kubernetes Repository
Welcome to the Jenkins GitOps Kubernetes repository! This repository contains the Kubernetes deployment and service manifests necessary for deploying applications using Jenkins in a GitOps workflow.

Overview
In this repository, you'll find deployment and service manifests that define how applications are deployed and exposed within a Kubernetes cluster. These manifests are managed and updated automatically through Jenkins pipelines, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

Getting Started
To get started with deploying applications using Jenkins and Kubernetes, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Configure Jenkins Pipeline: Set up Jenkins to trigger pipelines based on changes to this repository. Refer to our medium article for detailed instructions on setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and ArgoCD.

Update Manifests: Customize the deployment and service manifests according to your application requirements. Ensure that the paths and image references are correctly configured.

Commit Changes: Once you've made the necessary changes to the manifests, commit them to this repository.

Monitor Deployment: Jenkins will automatically detect changes in this repository and trigger pipeline jobs to deploy your applications to the Kubernetes cluster. Monitor the pipeline execution and deployment status in Jenkins.
